# Utopia
Like Yatopia, but Utopia. It's a simple Paper fork that aims to backport important patches from other Paper forks excluding game-breaking stuff. I want to keep Paper as vanilla as it can be.

This project will be ported to Fabric, and this version will be discontinued, after Minecraft 1.18 will be released.
